We have basic sections in HTML ie. Head and body. 

Head of the document defines data about the document. We can define things like
title of document, description, image, we can also head of the document to
import any resource 


In the document tag we will put all the HTML content. 
Body will be lot bigger than the head. 

Meta tag is a tag that will define information about our file.
Meta tag will come inside head tag. 

Inside body we can have
- head tag namely (h1 to h6)
- paragraph tag 
- (bold tag, italics tag) (<b> </b>, <i> </i>)

HTML lays our website in a specific way. We can change it. 
ie say we have two paragraph tag. If we change the order the browser will also
change the order. 

Break tag - <br /> (creates a newline)
Horizontal rule tag - <hr /> (this is gives us a straight line, used to separate contents)

Big tag, Small tag (used to make us text bigger or smaller)
<big> </big>, <small> </small>

Subscript and Superscript tag
Subscript - <sub> </sub> 
Superscript - <sup> </sup> 

Comment in HTML -  <!-- This is sample html  -->

Inside body tag we can have 
<header>
	<nav> </nav>
</header>
<main> 
	<article>
		<section>
		
			<aside>
			</aside> 
		</section>
		<section>
		
		</section>
	</article> 
</main>
<footer> 
</footer>

Any naviagational items such as lists or links should be placed inside nav tag. 
We can put article inside article tag. 
We can put each section of article(say) inside section tag.
Inside aside tag we can put advertisement kind of things. We can put anything that is
not direclty related to the website. 


Links : 
Link is the most popular HTML element which is used to link to other websites on the internet.
 <body>
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"
      ><h1><i>Google's Homepage</i></h1></a
    >
  </body>
  
  target = "_blank" is used to open the link in new tab 
  
using link tag we can link to another website on the internet or link to another html page in
our directory or link to an file(image,pdf,word) in the directory. 

image tag will come inside body tag. alt inside image is used to dislay the message when 
the image is not available. 


list tag - this also will come inside body tag. 
two list is available. one is unordered list and ordered list. 


It's good to wrap up HTML element because we can use this wrapping to style specific elements
in HTML. 

Two popular container to wrap HTML is div and span. 

HTML can display block element and inline element. 
Block element are HTML element which take entire width of the page. 
Inline element take only space as much as they need. 

Links are inline elements. 
Spans are inline containers and divs are block containers. 


Input & Forms : 
Input tags used to collect input from users. Eg : Text Boxes, Check Boxes , Radio Buttons. 
When we are defining these input elements in HTML , we are not making them functional. For that use JS.
